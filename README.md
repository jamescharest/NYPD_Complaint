# NYPD_Complaint
NYC Complaint Data

As part of the #21daystodata program by Avery Smith, we looked at a Kaggle Dataset, taken from the NYC Open Data website.  We cleaned the data, using OpenRefine and Microsoft Excel, created a dashboard in Tableau to visualize the data, and presented our initial findings.  We also queried the data with SQL, and conducted some data wrangling and visualizations with Python.
